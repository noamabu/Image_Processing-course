# Image Processing Implementation ‚Äì Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations created as part of the **Image Processing Implementation** course at the Hebrew University.

The course focuses on the practical aspects of computer vision and image/audio processing, combining core theoretical concepts with real-world applications. Each exercise demonstrates a different technique used in modern image and signal processing pipelines.

## üìö Course Topics Covered

The projects are inspired by a variety of topics, including:

- Image capture and digitization  
- Frequency analysis (FFT, convolution)  
- Audio signal enhancement  
- Image enhancement and restoration  
- Image pyramids and multi-resolution techniques  
- Geometrical transformations and warping  
- Image alignment and robust matching (e.g. RANSAC)  
- Hybrid images and seamless blending  
- Foundations of image compression  
- Introduction to neural methods in vision

## üß† What‚Äôs in this Repository?

The repository includes multiple standalone exercises, such as:

- Audio denoising using frequency domain filtering  
- Multi-resolution image blending using Laplacian pyramids  
- Image alignment and seamless overlay using feature matching  
- Hybrid image creation by combining frequency bands  
- (and more‚Ä¶)

Each script is self-contained and demonstrates a specific technique. All code is written in Python, using libraries like `numpy`, `opencv`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the code, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib scipy
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Each exercise can be run independently:

```bash
python ex2.py
python ex3.py
python ex4.py
```

You may need to supply appropriate input files (e.g. `.wav`, `.png`, image masks) for each script to run.
