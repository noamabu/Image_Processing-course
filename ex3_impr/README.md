# Image Blending with Pyramids

This project implements **image blending** techniques using **Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids**, as well as **hybrid image creation** using multi-resolution fusion.

## ✨ Features

- Build Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids
- Blend two images using a blending mask
- Create hybrid images by interpolating pyramid levels

## 🧪 Example Functions

- `images_blending(image1, image2, mask)`
- `hybrid_image(image1, image2)`

## 📚 Related Topics

- Image pyramids
- Multi-resolution blending
- Hybrid images
- Frequency-based fusion

## ▶️ Run

```bash
python ex3.py
```

Make sure your input images and mask are available in the current directory.
